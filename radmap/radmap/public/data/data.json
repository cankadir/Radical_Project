By the end of the month around 14 Christians were killed and more than 13,000 were forced to flee to Nineveh Plains. Seven bodies belonging to Christians were found in the streets of Mosul on early November. A house belonging to Syriac Catholic sisters was attacked and two nuns were killed and a third severely injured. Around 500 families were forced to flee the city as a result, where they found refuge in Churches and with relatives in nearby villages.",

Although the majority of the population welcomed the building of the Mother Theresa Cathedral in the centre of Prishtina \u2013 viewing it as a symbol of religious tolerance in Kosovo, some individuals spoke in dissatisfaction. Those criticizing the decision to build the Cathedral considered it as a discriminatory action against the Kosovo Muslims (greater in number than the minority Christian community) whose request to build a Grand Mosque had been initially rejected \u2013 raising concerns about the poor facilities in their existing mosques. Thus, the objection to building the Cathedral was not an objection towards Christianity, rather towards what was perceived as preferential treatment of Kosovo Christians as authorities sought to tighten links with a mostly Christian EU.
